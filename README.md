# Store_Time_Series_Analysis
This is the project which is based on time series analysis. 
where expection is to predict the next year's Sales and profit. 
we are using the Facebook Prophet library to carry out the project.

Firstly, the data was analysed and some questions were answered which were expected by the clients to ask, the aim of this analysis is to get th most useful insights which can be helpful in solving the business problems. So, trying to get some insights from the data using Exploratory Data Analysis. This is Time Series problem which mainly focuses on the analysing the hot selling products, sales trends considering demand of the customer and supply by the seller.

Data contains the date (Day, Month, Year) – Order date and shipping date, ship model (4 types of shipment options), segment (3 categories), city (529 cities), state (49 states), Region (4 Regions), category (3 categories), sub-categories  (17 subcategories).

What can we derive from the data

Q1. Which is the Most selling product ?

When we calculate most selling product, we can either derive it by number of products being sold or the greatest number of sales generated by the resp. products. Either go with number of product or sum of sales or both.
For displaying the list of products, we’ve used bar plot of matplotlib library.

 Q2. Which is the Least selling product 

Again, here we can add least selling product, not really necessary but we can add a simple line of code. In this code there are several products having the least amount of sale i.e., lot of categories are having sale of 1 product each
There is no such need to display the least selling products because least number is 1 for all the 10 products.
There is no need to plot this graph as there are almost 94 products whose count is just 1. (Not demanding products or not trendy products)
