What can we derive from the data

## Question 1. Which is the Most selling product ?

When we calculate most selling product, we can either derive it by number of products being sold or the greatest number of sales generated by the resp. products. Either go with number of product or sum of sales or both.
For displaying the list of products, we’ve used bar plot of matplotlib library.
